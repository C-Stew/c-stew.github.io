## Summer is Here!

And with that, I'm out of school for a few months!

While search for a job, and then when I'm not working, I'll be filling my time by **spending it with all of you!**

So far, I've been streaming Dead Cells on Twitch the past few days, but I also plan to play some other games, including zelda randomizers.

If you're interested, catch me [here](https://www.twitch.tv/thec_stew) and hang out for a while!

**Cheers!**
