## I know it's been a while.

I made a wind waker mod, published my first 3D model, then up and disappeared.
There's one big reason: **School**

The fall semester started, and I had very little time to dedicate to my own hobbies. Starting now, I'm doing my best to change that.

### PS5 Streams

For years, I've really wanted to start streaming to Twitch or Youtube. I always had that motivation to do so,
but my perfectionistic nature in fine-tuning OBS prevented me from ever going live.

Now that I have a PS5, starting a stream is as simple as pressing a few buttons, and voila! I conducted a test
stream with Shadow of War [here](https://youtu.be/eDYzB8AZjQU), but it's nothing special. I just talked with my friend who's in chat for
the whole 75 minutes.

### Going Forward

As far as my video content is concerned, I have some ideas. My long-form, edited content will continue
to be zelda-oriented, likely randomizers and a few mod ideas I have.

**Currently, I plan to upload highlights from one or two Wind Waker randomizers a month, possibly from streams,
as well as streaming Witcher 3 at least once a week.** We'll see how well I can stick to a schedule, but
I'll do my best!

Anyway, thanks for reading through this, and I hope you'll continue to support me in the future!
